This plugin displays popups for recent sales pulled from WHMCS store to display on your WordPress site. This popups could be real sales or dummy(fake) sales.

== Description ==
Majority of website visitors will abandon their carts or fail to express interest in any of your store products largely due to lack of trust. Worry no more about this because this module lets your site visitors know that you have traffic and people are buying frequently from your shop. This builds up client confidence leading to more sales. Whenever a product is purchased clients/visitors who are online will see a notification popup displaying details of customer first name, location, the product they have purchased and the time elapsed since the product was purchased. This also creates a sense of urgency and makes customers feel more compelled to buy if they believe that they are about to miss out on the products that everyone else is buying. You can also create dummy sales to display if your WHMCS is not as busy as you would like it to be.
